      <h3>.val()</h3>
      <p>If you wish to retrieve the value of an input control, all you have to do is call .val().</p>
      <p>=> var value = $('#some-input-control').val();</p>
      <p>If you wish to set the value, simply pass the new value in as a parameter to the val function.</p>
      <p>If you wish to set a textbox to a blank value, simply use an empty string.</p>
      <p>=> $('#some-textbox').val('');</p>
      <h3>.html() and .text()</h3>
      <p>The two most basic functions for working with the content of an element are text and html. Both functions will return the entire contents of the element (if called without a parameter), or replace the entire contents with the parameter you provide. The difference between the two is encoding.</p>
      <p>If you use text, all special HTML characters, such as < and >, will be replaced with their encoded equivalents, such as &< and &>. This can be helpful when working with data from an untrusted source, as it will not be written out to the page as HTML.</p>
      <p>If you run the following code, the user will see: &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt;.</p>
      <p>=> $('#output').text('<strong>value</strong>')</p>
      <p>.html(), however, will return the contents and display the new content as HTML</p>
      <p>If you run the following code, the user will see: <strong>value</strong></p>
      <p>=> $('#output').html('<strong>value</strong>');</p>
    </div>
